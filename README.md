Objective: 

Evaluating the performance of AI models is a critical step in determining how effectively a model solves a particular problem. The goal of model evaluation is to assess whether the model generalizes well to unseen data, how accurately it makes predictions, and how reliable its results are in the context of the specific problem being solved. Proper evaluation helps in selecting the best model, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the model is robust and unbiased.
